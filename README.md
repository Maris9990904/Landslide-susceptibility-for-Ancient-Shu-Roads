> ⚡ **GPU Recommended**:
> For optimal performance, use a GPU (even older ones with ~8GB VRAM work well; 16GB needed for some large datasets).
> On CPU, only small datasets (≲1000 samples) are feasible.
> No GPU? Use our free hosted inference via [TabPFN Client](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client).
